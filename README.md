âš¡Tip: If your dataset is small and allowed to be shared, you can also include a **sample CSV/Excel** file in the repo. That makes it easier for others to test the dashboard.

Do you want me to also write a **short professional project description** (2â€“3 lines) for LinkedIn/Resume that complements this README?
